   * <B>Problem/Warning:</B> "EsriGeometry2SqlGeometry" came up during a HAZUS Tsunami run for Puerto Rico. This message appears when I go to Hazard > User Data > Level 1: Quick Look-Single Maximum Runup. As far as I can tell I applied all the correct inputs.

   * <B>Problem/Warning:</B> "Regional Aggregation Incomplete" when creating study area with Hazus 4.2 and running a Tsunami model.

   * <B>Solution:</B> Couldn't aggregate a region for a Tsunami run because I had never enabled the "tsunami" model when I installed HAZUS initially. To solve this go to start menu > programs. Find the icon for Hazus and right click on it. Select change and enable the tsunami modeler.
